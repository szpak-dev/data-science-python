### 3. **Mathematical Concepts (15-20 min)**
   - Introduce mathematical modeling and its importance in data science.
   - Discuss simple linear algebra concepts (vectors, matrices, matrix operations) and their relevance in model-building.
   
### 4. **Hands-on Exercise (10-15 min)**
   - A basic Python task like loading a dataset and performing simple operations (e.g., calculating means, sums, basic statistics).
