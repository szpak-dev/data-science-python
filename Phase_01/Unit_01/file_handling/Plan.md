#### **1. Introduction to File Handling**
- **Objective**: Understand how to work with files in Python.
- **Topics**:
  - What are files and how are they structured?
  - File paths and types of file operations (reading, writing, appending).
- **Activities**:
  - Discuss file modes: `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'b'`, `'x'`.
  - Example: Open a text file, read its contents, and print them to the console.

#### **2. Opening and Closing Files**
- **Objective**: Learn how to open and close files using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions.
- **Topics**:
  - `open()` and `close()` functions.
  - Context managers (`with` statement) to ensure files are properly closed.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a Python program to open a file, read its contents, and close it.
  - Use the `with` statement to rewrite the same program.

#### **3. Reading Files**
- **Objective**: Understand different methods for reading files.
- **Topics**:
  - Reading an entire file with `read()`.
  - Reading lines with `readline()` and `readlines()`.
- **Activities**:
  - Example: Read a file line by line and count the number of lines.
  - Compare the differences between `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` in terms of memory usage.

#### **4. Writing and Appending to Files**
- **Objective**: Learn how to write to and append to files.
- **Topics**:
  - Writing with `write()`.
  - Appending data using `'a'` mode.
  - Working with binary files.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a program that writes user input to a file.
  - Modify the program to append to the file instead of overwriting it.
  - Binary file example: Save and read binary data like images.

#### **5. File Handling Exceptions**
- **Objective**: Handle potential errors when working with files.
- **Topics**:
  - Common file handling exceptions: `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`.
  - Using `try-except` blocks to manage exceptions.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a program that handles errors when trying to open a non-existent file.
  - Demonstrate permission handling for file operations.

#### **6. Combining File Handling with User Input**
- **Objective**: Combine file handling operations with user input.
- **Topics**:
  - Saving user input into a file.
  - Reading data from a file and allowing the user to modify it.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a program that takes user input and writes it to a file, then reads the file and prints the contents.
  - Modify the program to allow the user to choose between reading, writing, or appending to the file.

#### **7. Working with CSV Files**
- **Objective**: Learn how to handle CSV files for structured data input/output.
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to the `csv` module.
  - Reading from and writing to CSV files.
- **Activities**:
  - Write a program to store user input into a CSV file.
  - Read the data back from the CSV file and print it to the console.
